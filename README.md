# Sensitivity-Analysis-for-Model-Parameters_DT_Regressor_Energy_Consumption
What the Model Shows: This analysis helps in understanding the ​​robustness​​ of the model to changes in input parameters and the ​​relative importance​​ of each parameter in affecting the model's accuracy.​​High Sensitivity​​: If a parameter has a high sensitivity coefficient (large range in model scores), it means that the model's performance is highly affected by changes in that parameter. This could indicate that the model is highly dependent on that parameter, and hence the parameter is critical for the model's predictions. It also suggests that if the real-world measurement of that parameter is noisy or inaccurate, the model's performance may degrade significantly.​​Low Sensitivity​​: A low sensitivity coefficient indicates that the model is robust to changes in that parameter. The parameter may be less important to the model's predictions, or the model may rely on other parameters.The plot visually compares how each parameter's variation affects the model. Lines that have a steep slope (either upward or downward) indicate a parameter to which the model is sensitive.
Why This is Important: ​​Model Reliability​​: By knowing which parameters the model is sensitive to, we can focus on ensuring the accuracy of those parameters in data collection. ​​Feature Engineering​​: It may highlight opportunities to improve the model by engineering new features from the sensitive parameters or by removing insensitive ones (if they are redundant). ​​Domain Understanding​​: It helps domain experts to validate whether the model's sensitivity aligns with domain knowledge.
